# NN_timeseries_prediction


The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data using advanced neural network architectures, namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). These models are particularly suited for time-series forecasting as they can capture temporal dependencies and patterns effectively.
